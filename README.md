Q1) Mention the working of Internet Website in Terms of Front-end & Back-end Divisions.
Solution-1 :-

The working of an internet website involves two main divisions: the front-end and the back-end.
Elaborating them:-

1.Front-End
The front-end refers to the client-side of a website that users interact with directly.
It involves the presentation and user interface of the website.
The technologies and languages used in front-end development consists of:
  a.HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
    HTML is used to structure the content and elements of a website. 
    It defines the layout, headings, paragraphs, images, forms, and other visual elements.

  b.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
    CSS is used to include design in the website.
    CSS is used to style the HTML elements, controlling their appearance, layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the website.

  c.JavaScript:
  JavaScript is a scripting language that allows the creation of interactive and dynamic features on the website.
  It enables functionality such as form validation, animations, sliders, and other client-side interactions.

2.Back-End
The back-end refers to the server-side of a website, where the data processing and logic reside.
It handles tasks such as database operations, user authentication, and business logic.
The technologies and languages used in back-end development include:
  a.Server-side languages:
    Popular server-side languages include Node.js.
    These languages are used to process and manage data, handle requests from the front-end, and interact with databases.

  b.Frameworks: Back-end frameworks provide a set of tools and libraries that simplify web development.

  c.Databases:
    Websites often store and retrieve data from databases.
    Common database technologies include MySQL, MongoDB, and SQLite.
    These databases help store, organize, and retrieve data efficiently.

In short, the front-end focuses on the user interface and how the website looks and feels, while the back-end handles the server-side processing, data management, and business logic. Both divisions work together to create a functional and engaging website for users.

Q2) What are tags in HTML? Explain the each category of tag with an Example.
Solution-2 :-

Tags in HTML are used to define the structure and presentation of web content.
They are enclosed within angle brackets (<>) and can have attributes that provide additional information.
Here are some categories of HTML tags:

a.Heading Tags: Used to define headings on a webpage. Example: <h1>This is a Heading</h1>

b.Paragraph Tags: Used to define paragraphs of text. Example: <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

c.Link Tags: Used to create hyperlinks to other web pages or resources. Example: <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>

d.Image Tags: Used to include images in a webpage. Example: <img src="Photo.jpg" alt="Photo">

e.List Tags: Used to create ordered or unordered lists or description lists. Example:

  <ul>
    <li>A</li>
    <li>B</li>
  </ul>
These are some examples, and there are many more tags available in HTML to structure and style web content.

Q3) Explain the working Procedure of Virtual DOM.
Solution-3 :-

The Virtual DOM is a concept used in web development frameworks like React to optimize the process of updating and rendering user interfaces. 
It works as follows:
a.When changes are made to the application's state, a virtual representation of the entire DOM is created, called the Virtual DOM.

b.The Virtual DOM is then compared with the actual DOM to identify the differences or updates.

c.Only necessary changes are applied to the real DOM, minimizing the number of updates required.

d.The updated DOM is rendered to the screen.

The Virtual DOM efficiently handles updates, resulting in a smoother user experience.

Q4) Mention some Differences between MySQL and No SQL.
Solution-4 :-

Differences between MySQL and NoSQL databases:

a.MySQL
  Data Model: MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS), which means it follows a structured data model.
  Scalability: MySQL databases can handle moderate to large-scale applications.
  Schema: MySQL requires a predefined schema, which specifies the structure and data types of the data to be stored.
  Data Integrity: MySQL enforces data integrity through referential integrity constraints, such as foreign key relationships and data type                     restrictions.

b.NoSQL
  Data Model: NoSQL databases use a non-relational or distributed data model.
  Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed for scalability.
  ACID Compliance: NoSQL databases often sacrifice full ACID compliance for performance and scalability.

Q5) Explain any one DBMS Technology in your own words.
Solution-5 :-

MySQL is one of the popular database management system (DBMS) technology that is used to organize and manage large amounts of data. It provides a reliable and efficient way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data for various applications. MySQL follows a client-server model, where multiple clients can connect to a central server to access and interact with the database. It supports the Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying and manipulating data. MySQL offers features such as data security, transaction support, and scalability. It is widely used in web development, empowering numerous websites and applications worldwide.
